Topic: Worst Case Runtime Analysis for the Tasks

Task0: 
O(1) --> accessing elements directly without iterating through the entire entries 

Task1:
O(n) --> iterating through the entries of both calls and texts csv's. 

Task2:
O(n) --> iterating through the entries of calls csv. 

Task3: 
PART-A
O(n*nlogn) --< In-built sorting function in Python is used which takes this time 

PART-B
O(n) - iterating through the entries and O(1) - constant time for arithmatic operations
Final Output - O(n) 

Task4: 
O(n) - iterating through the entries 
O(n*logn) - sorting function in Python 
Final Output - O(n*logn)
